# CS210

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project required creating an application in C++ that would display two clocks simultaneously: one in a 12-hour format and another in a 24-hour format. The main problem it was solving was ensuring that clients of Chada Tech could view time in both formats, which is important for international standards compliance (ISO 8601). The application needed to be efficient, secure, and maintainable, reflecting best practices in software development.

# What did you do particularly well?
I ensured that the code was well-organized into functions, making main() minimal. This made the code easy to read and maintain. I also implemented secure and efficient input handling, preventing invalid time inputs. The code was well-documented with in-line comments, making it easy to understand the logic and purpose behind each function.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance security by incorporating more rigorous validation checks on user input. This would further prevent edge cases where the input might cause unexpected behavior. Introducing polymorphism or an abstract class could allow for easier expansion if other time formats or features were needed in the future.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Implementing the time conversion between 12-hour and 24-hour formats was challenging, particularly ensuring that edge cases (like midnight and noon) were handled correctly. I overcame this by breaking down the problem into smaller steps and testing each case thoroughly. I used online resources and C++ documentation to implement input validation.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The techniques I learned in handling and validating user input can be applied to any program where secure and reliable input handling is necessary. Writing clear and concise documentation is another skill that will benefit me in my future coding.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I organized the code into functions and classes that each had a single responsibility, making the program easier to understand and modify. Variables, functions, and classes were named consistently and descriptively, which improved code readability. I also added comments throughout the code to explain the logic, which will help anyone who reads or maintains the code in the future.
